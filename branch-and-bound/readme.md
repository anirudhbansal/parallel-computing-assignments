##  Problem Statement


* Design a hybrid Branch-and-Bound Skeleton scheme for a target platform that
is a cluster of workstations.  



* Choose two hard / pseduo-hard problems (e.g. 0/1 KnapSack, TSP, Graph
Coloring, Factorization) and encode each of them using the Branch and Bound
skeleton.


* Implement your solution using MPI for message passing programming on the
cluster and OpenMP for shared memory programming within a single node.
Implement your solution in two steps:

1. MPI version where each process is single-threaded
2. OpenMP version to run in a multicore node
